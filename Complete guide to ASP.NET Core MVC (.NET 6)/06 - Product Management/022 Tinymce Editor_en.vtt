Last thing that I want to do, in fact, product is when we added a product, we have description.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.110
Let's add a rich text editor inside the description.

00:12.230 --> 00:18.890
So you can search for a tiny Ms Hickey, and that has the HTML editor right here.

00:19.460 --> 00:23.990
You can sign up for an account and you already have an account so that can be taken.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.570
Inside here, you will just need your API key.

00:29.430 --> 00:34.380
We have the API key right here, so we can just copy that script tag.

00:34.710 --> 00:39.930
Go back to our application and we will open up the dress code layout.

00:40.770 --> 00:47.040
Let's add that at the very end, with all the attached script tags that we have, then we will open

00:47.040 --> 00:53.460
up the absurd few contact product and here let's go back and see how to implement.

00:54.090 --> 00:59.520
We have a script tag in which we have the tiny AMC Dot initialize method.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.270
So let me just copy that.

01:02.790 --> 01:05.370
Go back to our application inside.

01:05.370 --> 01:09.300
Absurd if they scroll down, we have the script tag here.

01:09.690 --> 01:10.920
Let's have that code.

01:12.450 --> 01:15.120
So how this works is we have a selector.

01:15.540 --> 01:22.590
So as long as you have a text area on this page, it would automatically use that pretty simple.

01:23.010 --> 01:26.790
So if we save everything, go back and refresh.

01:27.120 --> 01:27.690
Perfect.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.570
Now we have a rich editor right here.

01:31.570 --> 01:37.630
So that being said, what I will do is I will create about five products and will continue from the

01:37.630 --> 01:38.460
next radio.

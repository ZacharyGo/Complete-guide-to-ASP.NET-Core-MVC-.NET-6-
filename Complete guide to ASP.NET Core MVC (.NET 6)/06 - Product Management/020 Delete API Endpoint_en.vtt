00:01.760 --> 00:05.150
The last thing that we want to work on is deleting a product.

00:05.870 --> 00:12.500
This time we want to use retailer to display a notification and when the model pops up, if a user clicks

00:12.500 --> 00:15.200
OK, then the product should be deleted.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.530
So with that also, we want to do something fancy.

00:20.590 --> 00:26.550
First, what we will do is if we want to use weed alone, we will have to create an API endpoint for

00:26.590 --> 00:26.670
the.

00:27.790 --> 00:35.830
So where we have our API calls here, we will have to implement the HTP delete so we can copy the post

00:35.830 --> 00:45.730
that we have here based that inside the API and this one will be a step delete when deleting, we will

00:45.730 --> 00:46.990
receive an ID here.

00:47.290 --> 00:50.050
So we need to retrieve the product based on that.

00:50.740 --> 00:58.540
If the product is now, we return back by Jason Webisode with success of files and message we can edit

00:58.720 --> 00:59.650
by deleting.

01:00.430 --> 01:06.400
Then before we actually delete this product, we will have to remove the image that is associated to

01:06.400 --> 01:07.180
that product.

01:07.840 --> 01:13.630
So if we could upset post, let's copy the logic to delete that image right here.

01:14.650 --> 01:19.090
Let's scroll down and paste it inside the HTP delete.

01:19.450 --> 01:25.020
We would need that w w w a root pad that is inside post environment.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.700
Don't publish it back then.

01:27.700 --> 01:34.870
We don't have the product of this product itself, so that looks good, whether it delete the old image,

01:34.870 --> 01:40.930
if that exist and after that, we want to remove the product and that looks good.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.690
We need to explicitly save the changes and then we do not want to temp data.

01:46.810 --> 01:50.980
That's some of that, rather than temp data that we just wouldn't.

01:50.980 --> 01:56.890
Adjacent response back to that success will be true and the message will be deleted.

01:56.890 --> 01:57.670
Successful.

02:00.350 --> 02:05.510
Now, of course, you can use the term data, because with that, we have the built-in notification

02:05.900 --> 02:09.380
inside the shared folder where it started right here.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.220
But I actually want to use toaster without that.

02:13.580 --> 02:19.190
So what we will do is copy that URL and go to underscore play out with it.

02:19.190 --> 02:21.530
Add that right here as well.

02:22.550 --> 02:27.140
Let me show you how going to consume this delete post in the next video.

02:27.690 --> 02:31.700
We call this delete and not delete post that looks good.

02:32.330 --> 02:36.980
We do not want to delete action method so we can remove that altogether.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.910
Now, let's call this delayed API endpoint from product changes in the next video.

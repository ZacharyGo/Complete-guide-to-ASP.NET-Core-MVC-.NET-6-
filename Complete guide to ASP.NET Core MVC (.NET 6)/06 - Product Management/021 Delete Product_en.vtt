WEBVTT

00:01.980 --> 00:07.470
The last thing that we want to do is create a function here, that group responsible to delete that

00:07.470 --> 00:08.040
product.

00:08.970 --> 00:11.490
So I would call this function delete.

00:11.940 --> 00:18.810
And let's say here we've passed a euro that we have to invoke to hit our endpoint and take the product

00:18.810 --> 00:21.120
controller, which is right here.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.670
So let me switch back here.

00:24.030 --> 00:25.680
We want to call sweet alert.

00:26.250 --> 00:33.480
So if we go back to your browser and search for tweet alert in the example, let me search for 10 because

00:33.480 --> 00:35.340
we want to wait for a response.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.110
Let us try this.

00:38.160 --> 00:38.910
Not that.

00:39.090 --> 00:40.200
Let me scroll down.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.860
I think this one is much better audio show.

00:44.220 --> 00:45.000
Yes, delete.

00:45.210 --> 00:52.200
Then we want a notification that will copy the sweet alert and we will paste that in our function.

00:53.260 --> 00:57.490
When the result is confirmed, we do not quantify a Newsweek alert.

00:57.910 --> 01:01.900
We will have to make an Ajax request to hit that endpoint for delete.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.330
So we will say Ajax here.

01:04.990 --> 01:07.510
Inside there, we want to hit a wall.

01:08.830 --> 01:11.650
Thank you what we received in the parameter here.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.990
We will use that next.

01:13.990 --> 01:24.030
That time will be delete because if you examine the controller, we have HTP delete after that on success,

01:24.040 --> 01:28.330
we want to create a function that will receive some data.

01:30.430 --> 01:37.270
Now, if you examine the product controller and Jason, we are passing some data on error as well as

01:37.270 --> 01:38.560
successful deletion.

01:39.670 --> 01:46.930
So we will receive that data here and on that data, if we go back, we have a property with the name

01:46.930 --> 01:52.450
of success and message so we can see here if data are success.

01:52.810 --> 01:57.610
If that is true, then we want to use the toaster notification.

01:58.180 --> 02:05.500
We added that toaster on discord layout so we can use that we will adjust the toaster, that success

02:06.310 --> 02:12.040
and we will display data that message in the Allspark.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.540
We have some error.

02:13.870 --> 02:18.370
So we will display a toaster, that error and data anti-tax message.

02:19.240 --> 02:24.970
One thing that I want to do is if the delete was successful, I want to reload our data table.

02:25.930 --> 02:26.980
So we have that.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.020
In fact, the variable data table.

02:29.590 --> 02:37.210
So right here we can see a data table that Ajax that reload with that change.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.360
Let me save everything and run the application.

02:41.560 --> 02:48.050
Let me add a debugging point inside the delete endpoint now with twenty twenty two.

02:48.340 --> 02:51.100
We have something known as temporary break point.

02:51.640 --> 02:57.970
You just need to right click here and we can insert a temporary breakpoint once this breakpoint has

02:57.970 --> 02:59.590
head, that will go away.

02:59.950 --> 03:05.200
That way, we do not have to worry about the hassle of removing the breakpoint every time.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.870
Let's go to product here and let me create a new temporary product.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.460
That shows an image.

03:19.930 --> 03:21.610
And hit the Create button.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.770
Let's try the delete.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.910
When we hit delete here, we do not get any sweet alert.

03:28.630 --> 03:30.460
And of course, we will not get that.

03:31.030 --> 03:35.320
We added this function of delete, but did we call it on the delete button?

03:35.650 --> 03:36.410
We did not.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.620
So instead, this anchor tag we want to call it on.

03:40.630 --> 03:44.350
Click here, and we want to invoke the delete function.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.350
Here we need to pass that you are L.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.210
That is inside admin.

03:49.510 --> 03:54.580
We have product and then we need to pass the I.D. supplier's dollar.

03:55.030 --> 04:00.100
We will pass that data, which has the idea of the product that needs to be deleted.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.350
That can save this.

04:02.590 --> 04:05.860
Go back and refresh and hit delete one more time.

04:06.280 --> 04:06.820
Perfect.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.570
We have suite alert here.

04:09.050 --> 04:16.330
If you click on cancel and nothing happens, let's try to hit delete and it should hit an endpoint that

04:16.330 --> 04:17.080
it does not.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.450
Let me see what happened here.

04:19.840 --> 04:20.860
We have an error.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.030
Let's see that.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.370
Thank you, are out is incorrect.

04:25.550 --> 04:32.960
Let me go back here and after product, we need to add the action method name, which is to lead, but

04:32.960 --> 04:34.550
see that right here.

04:35.270 --> 04:37.340
Also, this quote will not be here.

04:37.730 --> 04:41.420
It will be after the data like this.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.890
With that, let me see if that changes.

04:45.190 --> 04:47.890
Let's go back and refresh here.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.110
Let's try this one more time and perfect radar break point.

04:54.620 --> 05:00.920
The image is also getting deleted, product is removed from the database and we go back.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.600
Delete was successful.

05:03.640 --> 05:08.380
So with this, all the current operations on product are now working successfully.

05:09.310 --> 05:15.610
We spent a lot of time on product, but if you examine we have done things way differently now, we

05:15.610 --> 05:19.180
have a nice day at our table here when we are creating a product.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.700
We have emerged that we are taking care of.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.310
We have dropdowns where we saw a few back view data and view models.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.580
So everything is working as expected.

05:31.150 --> 05:36.040
One last thing I noticed here is packed list is taking it back to cover tape.

05:36.430 --> 05:37.390
Let me fix that.

05:39.350 --> 05:46.990
So insert the absurd page here, if we scroll down where it is that there should be tracked.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.220
So with that, we have done with the product.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.890
Let's continue from the next section.

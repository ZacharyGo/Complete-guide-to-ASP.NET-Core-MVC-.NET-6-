WEBVTT

00:01.490 --> 00:03.140
And we're updating the product.

00:03.380 --> 00:10.610
We need to populate out of the details so that switch back to the application here and we will work

00:10.820 --> 00:12.350
on the product controller.

00:12.890 --> 00:14.450
Let's stop the application.

00:15.320 --> 00:21.230
If they scroll up, we would have to go to the absurd get action method right here.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.920
It does not matter if the ID is not or not.

00:25.460 --> 00:29.780
We still need to load our view model with the drop down menu.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.700
What will be different right here?

00:31.940 --> 00:34.100
If product is now, that looks good.

00:35.090 --> 00:40.640
If that is not now, this means that we need to modify the product fuel model dark product.

00:41.090 --> 00:47.810
We have to load our product from unit of work dock product that get first our default.

00:48.590 --> 00:55.940
We need to pass the link expression here so you that it is equal equal to the ID that we receive in

00:55.940 --> 00:57.830
parameter right here.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.890
So based on that, people retrieve the product when we retrieve the product.

01:04.070 --> 01:09.470
We do not want any of the foreign keys like category or cover type to be loaded.

01:10.130 --> 01:12.800
So we do not want to include any properties.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.160
Once the product is loaded, we can return back to the View with the product view model.

01:20.150 --> 01:23.570
We can cut this and paste it right here.

01:24.530 --> 01:25.490
Let's throw up.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.470
Everything looks good.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.510
Let's run the application.

01:32.110 --> 01:33.730
Let's go to product here.

01:34.770 --> 01:35.940
And let's edit.

01:37.210 --> 01:37.810
Perfect.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.060
We can see everything is loaded, including the category and cover type.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.720
Let's change the display name for these properties.

01:47.500 --> 01:54.610
So let me stop the application with a modified that inside the product model, where we have the cover

01:54.610 --> 02:01.070
type with a display name is equal to what we just call it cover type.

02:02.080 --> 02:11.500
Let me copy that for category where we scroll up the price hundred, we will call it price 400 plus

02:12.310 --> 02:16.300
that will cover this price for fifty two hundred.

02:16.810 --> 02:22.210
And right here we will paste that price for one to fifty.

02:23.170 --> 02:29.470
And this will be 51 to 100 and perfect that looks good for the display price.

02:29.860 --> 02:34.810
I will add one more here and I'll say this list price.

02:35.950 --> 02:42.520
The next thing that we want to worry about is on the post action matter of absurd what should happen

02:42.520 --> 02:43.720
if we are updating?

02:44.650 --> 02:46.870
Let's do that in the next week, you.

00:01.500 --> 00:07.620
I hope you were able to figure out on why it is actually creating a record rather than updating the

00:07.620 --> 00:08.700
existing record.

00:09.450 --> 00:16.320
The reason behind that is we are checking if the product is equal equal to zero, then we are adding

00:16.740 --> 00:17.970
as we are updating.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.600
In this case, the ID is always zero.

00:22.380 --> 00:28.980
And the reason behind that is if we go to our absurd view, when a form is posted, all the properties

00:28.980 --> 00:31.290
that are within here will be posted.

00:31.950 --> 00:39.510
We have title description, ISBN and so on, but we do not have it in any of the input field.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.870
We are just using that here for the if condition.

00:43.230 --> 00:47.490
But if it is not in an input field, then it will not be posted.

00:48.330 --> 00:51.420
So because of that, it would always be civil.

00:52.230 --> 00:56.310
So what we have to do is we need the ID inside and input.

00:56.610 --> 01:05.100
We could use the ESP five tag helper and we find that inside the product start, adding We need to make

01:05.100 --> 01:10.140
sure this is a hidden field and that way the idea would be populated.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.440
So with this change, let me save it here.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.660
Go back and refresh here.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.020
Let's try to edit the product one more time.

01:19.390 --> 01:24.930
So they changed this to three right now and let me go back to our product controller.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.480
Let me add a debugging point here.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.310
Let's get the update button.

01:31.540 --> 01:38.830
You will notice the fine here is now, so that is perfect this time, if you examine the obituary here

01:39.190 --> 01:42.010
product, the ID will be populated.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.170
Let's continue here.

01:44.770 --> 01:49.780
Sometimes you get that error when you are debugging, you just need to stop and restart.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.170
Let's go back to our product here.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.320
And let's edit this.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.010
That said, they'd continue.

02:03.380 --> 02:06.020
This time it has been updated successfully.

02:06.770 --> 02:09.170
But I want to show you one thing here.

02:09.650 --> 02:11.960
Let's change the image to sunset.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.210
That's the update button.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.890
If you notice the file here, that is perfect, it is coming along.

02:19.580 --> 02:22.640
But if you press F 10 here, let's go back.

02:25.630 --> 02:32.020
If you examine the product, that image, you are ill, that is now even though we have an image for

02:32.020 --> 02:34.900
that product, this image you are is no.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.570
The reason for that is same.

02:37.990 --> 02:41.110
We do not have that inside the form attribute.

02:41.470 --> 02:43.810
That is why it is not finding that image.

02:43.810 --> 02:44.500
You are wrong.

02:45.490 --> 02:51.070
So even if the image you are at least present, if it says that that is now, it will just create a

02:51.070 --> 02:54.070
new entry that is not what we want.

02:54.580 --> 03:00.820
Even though this will work, but what will happen is the old images will get accumulated and they won't

03:00.820 --> 03:01.600
be deleted.

03:02.290 --> 03:04.240
So that may stop the application.

03:04.390 --> 03:10.560
And how do we fix that in order to fix that or will go back to the absurd here?

03:10.960 --> 03:14.700
And let's also add hidden property for image.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.620
You are held intact product.

03:18.130 --> 03:19.180
We have that image.

03:19.390 --> 03:22.300
You are our safe back.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.070
And that's one of the application.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.180
Let's go to our product here.

03:31.140 --> 03:37.710
And let it added now when we want to see that image court updated or not, it makes sense to add that

03:37.710 --> 03:40.740
image on the right hand side corner right here.

03:41.520 --> 03:49.680
So what we can do is if we go back here to our upset view and we have the main draw right here inside

03:49.680 --> 03:51.360
there and make this a column.

03:51.390 --> 04:00.500
12, not everyone that's had a design right here with an additive middle class off row inside there

04:00.510 --> 04:01.880
for another day.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.080
Give it a class of column.

04:04.080 --> 04:04.500
10.

04:05.280 --> 04:12.300
This will hold all the main information and add another to give it a class of column to.

04:13.310 --> 04:20.840
So the main gift that I have have it put everything inside column 10 that will save that go back and

04:20.840 --> 04:22.980
refresh and perfect.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.790
Now we have some space on the right side there.

04:27.150 --> 04:31.680
So scroll down and inside the column to reverse the image.

04:32.010 --> 04:41.730
So it is equal to model dot product, that image you are out with, add some styling like with 100 percent

04:42.210 --> 04:44.940
and supporter radius and broader color.

04:46.050 --> 04:49.170
Let's go back and refresh and perfect.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.100
That's a line that let me add some padding.

04:55.140 --> 04:56.700
And this looks much better.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.790
So with this, we have an image right here.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.470
Let's try to change that to this image.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.370
Weather also check one thing the old image should be deleted.

05:08.760 --> 05:14.730
So right now, there are two images here that have been that go back and hit the update button.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.340
We had a break point here.

05:17.790 --> 05:20.580
Let's examine and we get the edit again.

05:20.970 --> 05:24.810
Let me stop and run the application one more time.

05:26.070 --> 05:29.780
As long as the image is available inside the image, you are down.

05:30.210 --> 05:32.310
The old image will be deleted.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.190
Let's continue here.

05:50.860 --> 05:55.840
And the energy water is populated, the old image gets deleted.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.960
You can see now we have only one image here.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.240
The new image will be copied over 10 perfect looks good.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.180
Let me remove the debugging point here.

06:08.770 --> 06:12.070
And if we click on Edit again, we have the new image.

06:13.270 --> 06:15.460
I will update some of the details here.

06:15.910 --> 06:19.040
Change this to romance and soft cover.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.970
Let's head update perfect.

06:22.390 --> 06:25.330
So both of the books that we have are looking great.

06:26.540 --> 06:31.010
The last functionality that I want to work on is deleting an existing book.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.830
Let's do that in the next week, you.

00:01.670 --> 00:07.820
Now we want to work on the details page for that, what we will do is we will display all the product

00:07.820 --> 00:14.870
details on that page and then for those product details, we will ask the user how many products you

00:14.870 --> 00:17.090
want to add to the shopping cart.

00:18.020 --> 00:22.160
So let's go back to our controller inside the home controller.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.390
Let me stop this.

00:23.740 --> 00:31.520
We will copy the index action method and we will create a detailed action method inside detail.

00:31.610 --> 00:32.960
We do not warrant a list.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.940
We just want a single product.

00:35.330 --> 00:41.560
So we would retrieve that, and I can call this as a product rather than get all.

00:41.930 --> 00:44.330
We will have to get first our default.

00:45.310 --> 00:50.860
In the action method here, we will receive an I.D. for which we won't to view the details.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.080
So inside the gate first our.

00:54.010 --> 01:02.530
We will have our link expression you close to you that it is equal, equal to the I.D. We will return

01:02.530 --> 01:04.060
back our product model.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.490
No one checked the details page.

01:06.490 --> 01:12.130
We also need the number of account that user wants for that product in their shopping cart.

01:12.940 --> 01:17.710
So we need to create a few model since product will not be sufficient.

01:18.310 --> 01:22.630
And once the user adds that, we will be adding that to the shopping cart.

01:23.590 --> 01:26.050
So it makes sense to create a view model.

01:27.400 --> 01:35.170
I recall that as a shopping cart, we can make that a public class video prop here.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.290
We will have a product and we will collect the same.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.650
Next, what we want is count for that product.

01:42.220 --> 01:49.930
So we're going to do prop integer where we'll have count here and we will act arrange validation that

01:49.930 --> 01:52.570
it must be between one and 2000.

01:53.350 --> 01:54.730
That looks very far now.

01:55.240 --> 02:01.080
Likely we will come back and modify our shopping cart in the future radios right now.

02:01.180 --> 02:06.400
If we go to our home controller here, we can create a shopping cart object.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.070
Let me press control dot.

02:10.810 --> 02:11.880
That's will we cart.

02:11.890 --> 02:14.230
OPG is equal to nil.

02:15.490 --> 02:19.600
And within the parameters here, we will assign those to product.

02:20.440 --> 02:27.490
So product is equal to the product here, and I want count to be defaulted to one.

02:28.090 --> 02:31.480
So right here we can set count is equal to one.

02:31.840 --> 02:32.680
That's perfect.

02:33.490 --> 02:41.200
Whether it would turn the card OPG to The View, and I'd say this in the next video, let's create the

02:41.200 --> 02:44.260
detailed view and display all the details.

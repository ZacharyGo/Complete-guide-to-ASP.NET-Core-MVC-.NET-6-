00:01.610 --> 00:04.340
Now it's time to work on the details for you.

00:04.790 --> 00:08.900
We can quite click on the action matter here and select Add View.

00:09.440 --> 00:14.780
You can either select the empty place there view and then you will have to rename the View based on

00:14.780 --> 00:15.800
the action method.

00:16.220 --> 00:21.710
But if you select the reserve you, you can see the view name is automatically populated.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.900
Then template will be empty.

00:24.090 --> 00:29.780
But this will not be a partial view, so we can uncheck that and hit the add button.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.740
So you can see we can use both the options that are available when we are creating use, when you use

00:37.740 --> 00:38.520
this approach.

00:38.790 --> 00:42.420
We have some new data and details that is populated.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.310
We will remove all of that.

00:45.030 --> 00:50.400
Let's make sure that you got added in the correct location set inside areas.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.640
We have home folder in that we have details.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.900
That is perfect.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.630
You should first think of what will be the model of this view.

01:00.200 --> 01:07.190
That is the first question you should ask for, and if you are razor pages that you create inside home

01:07.190 --> 01:14.690
controller details, we are passing a shopping cart object so we can copy that and paste that here for

01:14.690 --> 01:15.320
our model.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.750
It is not able to read that.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.000
Let's see where we have our model.

01:20.540 --> 01:23.120
This model, we placed it inside view model.

01:23.480 --> 01:30.050
It should actually be, in fact, the model's folder because we will be adding shopping cart to database

01:30.050 --> 01:30.830
pretty soon.

01:31.670 --> 01:35.420
So that will open this and make sure the namespace is correct.

01:35.780 --> 01:36.920
It will be models.

01:37.490 --> 01:40.550
And with that, it should recognize the shopping cart now.

01:41.390 --> 01:41.960
Perfect.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.390
Now what do we want to display here?

01:44.900 --> 01:47.780
We want to display all the details of the product.

01:48.350 --> 01:55.250
So rather than wasting our time, I have provided snippets that you can see on the lecture project resources

01:55.640 --> 01:58.160
in the first section in there.

01:58.160 --> 02:04.370
If your download project resources from Darknet Mastery and open them, you will see all the files.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.710
We will go to the attachments.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.080
Here we are in Section seven.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.350
We have the details.

02:11.360 --> 02:19.160
You, I, you will copy everything here and paste it inside to view once you examine what you pasted.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.410
There won't be any C-sharp code.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.060
It is just HDMI.

02:23.220 --> 02:26.030
A. Yes, so that's great.

02:26.180 --> 02:32.600
We always want to save our time with HDMI and CSX before we run our application.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.550
Let's go to the index page.

02:34.940 --> 02:42.530
Here we are navigating to the details section and we are passing the speed at which is the product title

02:43.220 --> 02:44.630
since we are passing that ID.

02:45.020 --> 02:48.620
We are retrieving that here and everything should work.

02:49.340 --> 02:52.910
So let's run the application and see what happens.

02:55.200 --> 03:01.110
So let's hit the details button and perfect, we have our template that is up and running.

03:01.830 --> 03:08.850
We just need to replace all of this dummy text with the actual text from our shopping cart dot product

03:08.850 --> 03:09.360
object.

03:10.290 --> 03:15.550
So let's go back and let's do that inside the details right here.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.640
Let me just add some padding top up.

03:17.640 --> 03:23.130
For first thing, we have time to do so in order to access model.

03:23.370 --> 03:27.600
We have Capital M Model Dot Product title.

03:28.800 --> 03:36.780
Let me just copy the Model Dot product page it before after we have Model Dot product author.

03:37.380 --> 03:44.820
Next, we want cover tight inside that we want to extract the name of the cover type and same will be

03:44.820 --> 03:46.500
valid for a category.

03:48.070 --> 03:53.650
Whether it's scroll down, we have the ISBN, so model dot product Dot ISBN.

03:54.340 --> 03:56.710
Next, we want to display the list price here.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.530
So model stock product list, right?

04:00.010 --> 04:06.700
And we want to convert that to currency so we can use to a string and we will try to see between that

04:06.820 --> 04:13.750
for currency that may copy the currency because here we need to display all the three price.

04:14.260 --> 04:22.090
You can see we have price for one two fifty fifty one, two hundred and hundred plus so far point fifty.

04:22.090 --> 04:26.260
We have price for fifty one two hundred.

04:26.270 --> 04:27.880
We have price fifty.

04:28.870 --> 04:31.660
And last one will be price, right?

04:35.060 --> 04:37.550
Let's scroll down, we have the description.

04:37.790 --> 04:41.600
So it's a model tart product description.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.820
Let me save all of this.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.350
Go back and refresh.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.050
Everything is coming along good.

04:48.260 --> 04:56.050
We have title author, cover type and category, and the price are also looking good right away.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.320
We have the description you can see it is adding the HDR content.

05:00.980 --> 05:04.850
That is because we have rich text editor for our description.

05:05.600 --> 05:13.640
So if you want to display Gmail, you will have to use HDMI 2.0 and within here you will pass the HDMI

05:13.640 --> 05:16.280
content that is inside description.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.860
Let's save that and refresh.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.690
And this looks much better.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.000
Next, we have to count here this we can find with that model.

05:26.540 --> 05:34.950
So instead of input, we can use ESP for tag helper and we want to bind this with count that way.

05:34.970 --> 05:41.030
Now, if you refresh, that default should be one because we are setting the default inside the home

05:41.030 --> 05:42.980
controller right here.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.970
So that looks great on the right side here.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.850
We want to display that image.

05:49.600 --> 05:56.800
So if we go back to details, I have the image as I see here, where we'll go to model dark product

05:57.070 --> 06:00.820
starting that, you know, let's refresh that.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.860
And this looks much better.

06:03.980 --> 06:06.190
Let's consider that back to last year.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.540
I thought, let me say back to home.

06:10.320 --> 06:15.900
And on this action method, it should go back to action of index.

06:17.480 --> 06:22.220
Liked what we have is add to cart button and we have type of segment.

06:22.790 --> 06:25.070
We have everything inside the phone tag.

06:25.400 --> 06:32.390
So when it is submitted where there's no like, what's the product, let's refresh back to home is functional.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.540
So with that, the details page of our shopping cart looks good.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.840
Let's continue from the next section.

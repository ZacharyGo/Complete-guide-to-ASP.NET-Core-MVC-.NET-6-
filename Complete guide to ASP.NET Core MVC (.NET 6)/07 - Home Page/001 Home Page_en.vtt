WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.770
Now I have created five products.

00:04.370 --> 00:08.660
What we want to do is on the homepage, let's display all the products.

00:09.830 --> 00:15.980
So I will start the application here, and we will be working inside the customer area.

00:16.220 --> 00:23.690
We have home controller and inside home we have the index view that will close everything else here

00:24.380 --> 00:25.700
with home controller.

00:25.730 --> 00:33.290
We need to get a unit of work to access all the product so that look at that and we at the using statement.

00:34.510 --> 00:35.800
Then insect index.

00:35.830 --> 00:38.770
Think about what will be the model that they will need.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.680
We need a collection of product.

00:41.860 --> 00:46.360
So we need to get all the product left and we have to send them to the view.

00:47.800 --> 00:55.120
So right here, we will get an innumerable way to control dark water using statement of generics.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.760
And this will be on product.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.740
We need a list of products.

01:00.070 --> 01:07.110
I will call this product list as equal opportunity for our product to get our.

01:08.040 --> 01:14.310
We want to retrieve all of the products, but when we do that, we also want to include the properties

01:14.760 --> 01:17.430
of category and cover type.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.510
If you make a case in mistake here, this won't work.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.970
So we have our product list.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.790
Let's give that product list to our few.

01:27.800 --> 01:34.430
Once we have that inside our view, if you right click here and go to view, we will navigate here to

01:34.430 --> 01:35.240
the home page.

01:36.420 --> 01:42.810
Inside any of The View, the first topic that you should do is to say what will be the model of this

01:42.810 --> 01:43.200
view?

01:43.920 --> 01:48.840
We are passing from controller and I innumerable of product.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.870
So that is what we will receive right here.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.020
You can see the product here is not found.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.990
That could be because of the view import.

01:58.500 --> 02:03.030
We already have the models, so I'm surprised why that is not found here.

02:03.570 --> 02:08.280
And you can see it is getting confused with the product index and product absurd.

02:08.920 --> 02:15.300
We want to go to the models here so we can directly say bulk book dark models dark product.

02:16.140 --> 02:21.210
Sometimes using the same names for folder can be confusing with the reference.

02:22.050 --> 02:29.650
Then we have our enumerable right here, so that will additive give that some bootstrap classes for

02:29.660 --> 02:32.280
row and padding bottom of three.

02:33.030 --> 02:39.180
What we want to do is we want to have a for each loop so that we can look through all of the products

02:39.180 --> 02:45.990
that we have and display them so we can say variable product in our model.

02:46.680 --> 02:51.090
When you define the model for the view, the end will always be lower case.

02:51.450 --> 02:57.750
And whenever you want to access the model that you defined here inside your view, that will be a capital

02:57.750 --> 03:05.730
M. Make sure to always remember that or else it won't work inside here would be to create a day of of

03:05.730 --> 03:13.020
class column large three so that in a large screen, we will see Ford products next to each other.

03:13.740 --> 03:20.280
And in a movie on screen, I can see empty six so that we can see two products next to each other.

03:20.670 --> 03:24.660
These are just bootstrap partition in here.

03:24.820 --> 03:32.790
We will create a class give back row and padding off to finally within that will additive give it a

03:32.790 --> 03:33.960
class of card.

03:34.350 --> 03:41.330
And let me also give batting one, give it a great border and a border radius of.

03:41.340 --> 03:42.240
I think so.

03:42.870 --> 03:47.820
Actually, I do not want card here that middle column 12 for the full plate.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.510
And finally, I will add a class of card.

03:52.920 --> 03:59.550
In fact, that we will be displaying the image so we can set the SIRC and that is inside our product.

04:00.060 --> 04:08.790
So here we will sit at the rate we have product dot image, the URL that will display an image and we

04:08.790 --> 04:13.770
will give it some bootstrap classes of card image top and rounded.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.430
So with that, our image looks good.

04:17.970 --> 04:23.340
Let's run the application and see if we can view the images for all the products.

04:25.610 --> 04:31.610
And great, we can see all the images, I have used a duplicate image here for two products.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.830
So I will fix that later on.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.830
Let's have more details right here.

04:37.870 --> 04:46.800
So if we go back after the image was additive, give it a class of padding left off one in there, we

04:46.810 --> 04:53.260
would add a paragraph, give that a glass of car title and heading five.

04:53.590 --> 04:56.020
We want to display that title of the book.

04:56.830 --> 05:04.330
I will also give that the Bush draft class text primary and the title will be inside product title.

05:05.230 --> 05:06.120
In the next line.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.750
We want to display the author.

05:08.020 --> 05:10.990
So let me copy and paste it one more time here.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.060
This won't be etch five.

05:13.210 --> 05:17.590
Let's remove that and we can make this text secondary.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.560
Here, we want to display the author name.

05:21.310 --> 05:22.420
Let me save this.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.040
Go back and refresh.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.570
And that looks good.

05:27.290 --> 05:33.830
Then we can copy this Dave bastard again with adding left one, we want to display the price.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.180
So in fact, photograph here we will see a list price colon.

05:38.540 --> 05:44.600
And then if you remember, we have the list price as well as the other price that we have with.

05:44.640 --> 05:50.450
We've had a strike here because we want the list price to be displayed in a bold attack here.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.080
We will see a dollar sign and then intact product.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.730
We have list price.

05:56.150 --> 05:59.630
I will convert that to two decimal, so we will set two.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.090
Zero point zero zero.

06:03.020 --> 06:03.930
Let's refresh.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.420
And this looks great.

06:05.870 --> 06:07.970
Our list price is cancelled out.

06:08.720 --> 06:14.120
And then on the next line, we want to display that this book is available as low as.

06:14.390 --> 06:20.930
And we want to display the Price 500 book because that is the lowest price that someone can buy.

06:23.630 --> 06:25.130
So let me copy this again.

06:25.420 --> 06:35.020
They said one more time, this time we will say as low as and inside bold will display price hundred.

06:35.570 --> 06:37.370
We don't want to strike that out.

06:37.970 --> 06:38.960
Let's remove that.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.430
Let me see if that.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.650
Let's go back and refresh.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.720
And this looks much better.

06:47.560 --> 06:52.040
Let me give this text in rather than second free and perfect.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.410
This looks much better.

06:55.060 --> 07:01.780
Now, I have added the same book two terms here, so let me go to product and added one of them.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.930
We do not have vanish in sunset.

07:06.290 --> 07:07.310
Let me add that.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.070
That's update.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.530
And go back.

07:18.500 --> 07:25.070
But in fact, a five books are looking great right now, so our homepage here looks good.

07:25.350 --> 07:31.340
But before the altar, we can add a by keyword right here before author.

07:31.670 --> 07:32.810
We can use by.

07:33.410 --> 07:34.550
Let me save that.

07:35.420 --> 07:36.590
And that looks good.

07:37.100 --> 07:46.460
Also, since we are inside card here, I can have a div gift that a class of card party and I will close

07:46.460 --> 07:48.110
that right here.

07:50.420 --> 07:50.970
Perfect.

07:51.020 --> 07:58.250
That is much better now in future, Apple, not waste time on trading or the bootstrap and styling that

07:58.250 --> 07:59.690
we did in this with you.

08:00.320 --> 08:05.390
And the reason is this course is purely on net core and MVC.

08:05.960 --> 08:13.400
So I want to give you guys as much as I can when it comes to MVC and darknet core rather than focusing

08:13.400 --> 08:14.270
on styling.

08:15.250 --> 08:22.000
So I will provide snippets moving forward, and I will show you how you can use them directly in the

08:22.000 --> 08:22.390
code.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.840
So that being said, the home page looks good.

08:26.140 --> 08:31.390
The only thing that remains here is adding a button to after card.

08:31.390 --> 08:36.600
Here we will add one death and an anchor tag in that anchor tag.

08:36.670 --> 08:39.100
We want to redirect to some action.

08:39.850 --> 08:47.740
Let's call that detailed action, and we will give it some bootstrap classes of BTN between primary

08:48.220 --> 08:49.810
and form control.

08:50.810 --> 08:58.000
Now, when we go to the details page, we will need the ID of the product so we can use the ESB route

08:58.300 --> 09:00.220
and we can pass the page either.

09:00.730 --> 09:03.580
This will be product that I.D..

09:05.290 --> 09:09.850
In fact, the anchor, Ted, let me display details, save this.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.810
Go back and take a look and perfect.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.660
This looks good.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.750
Let's continue from the next read you.

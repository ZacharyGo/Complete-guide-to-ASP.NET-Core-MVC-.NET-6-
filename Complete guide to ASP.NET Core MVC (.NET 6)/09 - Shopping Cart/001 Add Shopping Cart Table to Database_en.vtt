If we run an application, we have the details page where we are displaying all of the details.

00:08.570 --> 00:13.580
But now we work on the functionality of adding any item to the shopping cart.

00:14.390 --> 00:20.330
And for that, we want to create a table in our database to store a shopping cart for a user.

00:21.200 --> 00:26.150
So we will make sure that when a user clicks on add to cart, they must be signed.

00:26.150 --> 00:30.020
In that way, we can get that user ID of the user.

00:30.440 --> 00:36.800
We have the product data that they want to add, and lush property will be the quantity of the product

00:36.800 --> 00:37.460
they want.

00:38.210 --> 00:42.680
We need to store only those three details in the shopping cart table.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.770
So let me stop the application here and we have a shopping cart in our models.

00:49.010 --> 00:49.910
Let's open that.

00:50.780 --> 00:54.590
As I said before, we need the user ID and shopping cart.

00:55.160 --> 01:01.970
So we will add a string application user ID, and that will be the foreign key to application user.

01:03.120 --> 01:10.140
We already have the product navigation property here, so I would also add a product I.D. and the foreign

01:10.140 --> 01:12.440
key for the navigation property.

01:13.480 --> 01:20.530
Last but not least, we need the primary key off the table, which will be an night by itself, then

01:20.530 --> 01:22.120
for the navigation property.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.720
Let's try to validate, never input.

01:24.730 --> 01:28.270
The Senate goes that way if part of the state.

01:28.510 --> 01:31.090
We do not validate the navigation properties.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.870
This looks good for our shopping cart model.

01:35.410 --> 01:42.510
Let me close everything other than shopping cart and flip and go to data access data application deep

01:42.520 --> 01:43.270
context.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.720
We need to create the deep site for a shopping cart.

01:51.650 --> 02:01.300
Once we do this, we will have to add migration services to add migration and shopping cart to TV,

02:02.300 --> 02:06.950
make sure to change the default project here and attack the migration.

02:08.650 --> 02:14.260
In fact, it is adding the table shopping cart with the constraints of fighting key for application,

02:14.260 --> 02:17.290
user and product that looks scared.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.480
That update the database.

02:21.070 --> 02:25.990
So our shopping cart has been added to the database in the next video.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.830
Let's add that to our repository.

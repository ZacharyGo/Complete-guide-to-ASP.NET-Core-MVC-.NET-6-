00:01.680 --> 00:05.340
In the last radio, we added shopping cart to our database.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.280
Now let's add that in our repository.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.990
Also, if you notice in our models, we have application user so we can create a repository to work

00:15.990 --> 00:17.520
with that table as well.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.310
So that me add to that is based the category repository two times.

00:24.210 --> 00:31.980
First one will be the shopping cart repository and next that may be named the application user depository.

00:35.900 --> 00:42.380
So let me copy the name here, which is a shopping cart repository and open that up in here.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.800
Let's modify everything to be for a shopping cart.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.610
We do not want any update right now, so we can just remove that.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.900
We will just be using the basic methods that we have in the repository.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.670
We need to implement the interface.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.700
I will do that in just a second.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.180
Let me modify the application user as well.

01:06.930 --> 01:09.990
The model here will be application user.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.590
Inside user also, let's not worry about the update for now.

01:16.250 --> 01:22.850
So these two are very simple repositories where we are directly accessing all the methods that we have

01:22.850 --> 01:24.320
in the base repository.

01:25.490 --> 01:31.040
We should have implemented the interface first, but that's OK since we can just paste the category

01:31.040 --> 01:41.240
repository category repository interface and change that to be an application user repository that can

01:41.240 --> 01:45.380
copy that name and modify application user.

01:45.590 --> 01:47.450
We do not want the update method.

01:47.780 --> 01:50.900
We've removed that next to a category.

01:51.660 --> 01:54.830
This will be a shopping cart repository.

01:55.700 --> 02:00.140
We do not want to copy at the end that will copy that name there.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.540
And this looks good.

02:05.620 --> 02:09.460
So with this, we should not have any errors in the repositories.

02:10.240 --> 02:10.780
Perfect.

02:11.050 --> 02:15.430
Let me close all the tabs and modify our unit of foot interface.

02:16.450 --> 02:24.160
We have the shopping cart and I application user repository next modified the unit of work itself.

02:28.010 --> 02:36.980
We have the shopping cart there, and with a public eye application user repository here, we initialize

02:36.990 --> 02:40.640
the application user and the shopping cart.

02:42.270 --> 02:49.110
So with that God created us works, looks good for both the repository of shopping cart as well as application

02:49.110 --> 02:49.650
user.

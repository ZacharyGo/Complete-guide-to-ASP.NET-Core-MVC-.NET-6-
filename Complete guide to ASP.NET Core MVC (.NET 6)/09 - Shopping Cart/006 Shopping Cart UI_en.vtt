00:01.690 --> 00:08.140
Now we want to work on the shopping cart page, if we run the application, we are successfully able

00:08.140 --> 00:10.390
to add items to our shopping cart.

00:11.140 --> 00:16.660
What we want to work on is a page where we will display all the items that are added to the shopping

00:16.660 --> 00:17.080
cart.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.960
So far that right here on the navigation, let me add a link to go to that page.

00:23.980 --> 00:31.120
So I have a search for bootstrap icons again, and I want to search for the cart icon.

00:31.450 --> 00:32.440
Let's scroll down.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.610
The basic cart looks good that copy that.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.650
We've added to that in the underscore lay out M.P.H. right here.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.290
I've just turned a light tag.

00:44.950 --> 00:49.180
Give it the same bootstrap classes, which is nav item.

00:52.350 --> 01:01.020
And inside there, we will have anchor tag with the class of now link and be able to find the controller.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.090
This will go to card control.

01:03.090 --> 01:06.330
Controller action will be the index action.

01:07.110 --> 01:10.920
We have not added that, but we will add that very shortly.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.230
Let me paste the icon here.

01:13.830 --> 01:17.610
Go back and refresh and perfect looks good.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.350
So click here.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.430
Nothing happens.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.080
We need to add this page.

01:22.890 --> 01:28.920
So let me stop the application and add that, Mike, while I'm here, if you want, you can be explicit

01:28.920 --> 01:30.540
about the area as well.

01:31.170 --> 01:34.530
So Xperia one, be the customer India.

01:35.550 --> 01:44.790
So inside our customer area controllers, let's have a new controller with the name of card controller.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.090
Let's act this.

01:51.550 --> 01:56.500
And if you're going to be explicit here on the last name, we can define the area.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.920
This is inside the customer area.

02:00.610 --> 02:03.880
So with that index action method has been created.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.340
Let's also create a view for that.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.140
We're very quick ad you.

02:08.530 --> 02:14.230
We can go with the reserve you name index, so that looks good.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.870
We can add that a new folder is created for a card and that looks good.

02:20.710 --> 02:25.480
Let's run the application and make sure we are able to navigate to this page.

02:27.990 --> 02:35.070
If we click on here, it takes us to the new empty page that we entered so perfect, that looks good.

02:35.850 --> 02:38.920
And then for thank why I like to give snippets.

02:39.210 --> 02:46.590
So in section nine, we have the first one, which is the shopping cart UI, where the copy does go

02:46.590 --> 02:52.320
back while the application is running pasted here, come back and refresh.

02:53.340 --> 03:01.650
We have dummy data inside here with Gmail, and she says we have one card item like what we need to

03:01.650 --> 03:06.090
do is add a for each loop and for all the items in the shopping cart.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.980
We need to repeat this rule.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.060
So let's do that in the next review.

00:01.620 --> 00:05.580
Next, property that we want to work on is displaying the order total.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.920
So if we go back to our application and right here, let me stop this.

00:12.090 --> 00:15.360
What we can do is inside our shopping cart fuel model.

00:15.690 --> 00:21.190
We can add one more property, which will be double to hold the cart total.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.410
We need to calculate this inside the card controller.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.870
We already have a for each loop.

00:29.090 --> 00:36.590
So inside this for each loop, we can populate the shopping cart field model Dakar total plus equal

00:36.590 --> 00:44.570
to the want to multiply the car ticket price by the count and assign that to our total.

00:45.540 --> 00:50.880
Then inside the UI here, we just need to display that total right here.

00:51.690 --> 00:57.930
So we have that insight model Dakar total, and we will convert that to currency.

00:58.860 --> 01:02.130
Let us run the application and see the cart total.

01:04.590 --> 01:08.370
Let's log in here and let's go to the shopping cart.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.760
Let me just make sure the total is correct.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.890
So thirty four times 58.

01:14.310 --> 01:15.360
That's 50.

01:15.870 --> 01:16.890
And that looks good.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.280
So our car total is working as expected.

01:21.380 --> 01:26.120
Now in the next video, let's work on the plus minus and delete button.

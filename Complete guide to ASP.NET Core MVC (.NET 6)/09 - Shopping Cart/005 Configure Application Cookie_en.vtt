Now we saw an error while they were adding items to their shopping cart.

00:06.140 --> 00:12.680
So if we look out here, if we go to details and hit the add to cart button, you can see it is taking

00:12.680 --> 00:15.740
us to some dummy page, which is inside account.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.540
Log in with a returned.

00:17.540 --> 00:18.170
You are.

00:19.310 --> 00:25.280
So what are destroying is it knows that the user is not logged in and the post-election method is only

00:25.280 --> 00:31.850
for authorized user, so it is trying to redirect you to the logging page, but you are left.

00:31.850 --> 00:38.670
Log in is incorrect because we have the identity area, so it should be identity and then that you are

00:38.670 --> 00:41.000
out and you can see that works.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.740
So how can we change the default logging euro?

00:45.470 --> 00:53.070
We can do that by modifying the application cookies and that will be inside the program class file program

00:53.070 --> 00:53.300
part.

00:53.510 --> 00:59.300
Yes, we have multiple parts like log in, log out, access to mind and much more.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.810
We can give them the custom route if, let's say, for example, you are not working with identity and

01:05.810 --> 01:11.810
you want a custom page in some other location in that case on the builder dot service.

01:12.140 --> 01:18.980
We have to configure application cookie and that you can provide the options and give the custom paint

01:19.640 --> 01:20.480
like right here.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.420
I'm just giving the existing pad to the identity.

01:23.420 --> 01:27.020
Pages like log impact is inside identity.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.900
We have account and then we have log in.

01:30.740 --> 01:34.340
So I'm giving log in that log out pad and access denied.

01:35.270 --> 01:38.150
These are the three default pads for the application.

01:38.690 --> 01:44.510
If you do not override them, the default implementation for them right now is directly account and

01:44.510 --> 01:45.350
access denied.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.840
And that is why it was not working.

01:48.560 --> 01:53.210
So with this change, let's run the application and try that one more time.

01:54.720 --> 01:55.560
We have not got.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.830
Let's go to details and hit add to cart.

01:59.400 --> 02:04.560
It will ask us to log in and once we log in, it will take us back to the same page.

02:05.250 --> 02:11.310
So with that, an application cookie is set perfectly with the lock in, lock out and access denied

02:11.310 --> 02:11.760
content.

Once the shopping cart looks good, you, sir, will hit the summary button.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.210
Now what would that page look like?

00:08.220 --> 00:13.980
That is the main question so far that I already have a why that is designed.

00:14.910 --> 00:19.920
We can't go to our controller court controller and let's have an action method.

00:20.480 --> 00:27.000
Just copy the index action here based at one more time for summary.

00:28.170 --> 00:30.450
I can comment on of the cold out here.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.130
We do not care about that.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.650
We can just return back to the view.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.250
Let's right click on summary at that view.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.340
We can go with greater view empty here.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.530
We need to rename this to match our action matter, which is summary.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.300
And let me add that.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.690
Next, the way I provide that in snippets, so we will go to section nine.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.010
Somebody here, why?

00:56.280 --> 00:58.800
Copy and paste it right here.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.480
Everything is pure e-mail.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.720
And he says nothing fancy.

01:04.530 --> 01:07.770
Let's run this and see what the UI looks like.

01:08.070 --> 01:12.240
And based on that, we can determine what will be the model of this view.

01:14.990 --> 01:19.250
Let's go to our card now again here and hit the summary button.

01:19.820 --> 01:27.050
Of course it won't work because if we go back to the index and when we scroll down to the summary link

01:27.050 --> 01:31.280
here, we have to add the action, which is summary.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.950
Let me save that and refresh.

01:34.730 --> 01:38.840
Let us quick summary and it loads our final summary way.

01:39.920 --> 01:45.110
So let's pause for a minute here and analyze what will be on the data that we will need here.

01:45.950 --> 01:51.530
So on the left side, we have the shipping details, which has name, phone number and street address

01:51.710 --> 01:53.480
city state postal code.

01:54.230 --> 01:57.590
On the right hand side, we want to display on the order summary.

01:58.340 --> 02:04.040
And when we hit the place all karapatan, we need to create an order inside our database.

02:04.730 --> 02:09.200
So with that, we need a design of table to store all of the order details.

02:09.890 --> 02:17.000
Typically, whenever an order is placed that has two parts, one is the order header and next one is

02:17.000 --> 02:20.100
the order details inside order header.

02:20.120 --> 02:26.870
We have all the details about the order, like mail shipping address, maybe a carrier details tracking

02:26.870 --> 02:29.510
number, order total and so on.

02:30.380 --> 02:35.570
In fact, order details we have all of the products are items that are within that order.

02:36.170 --> 02:39.560
So that is like a detail about what that order is about.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.060
What is the name?

02:41.090 --> 02:43.250
What is the price of the individual item?

02:43.280 --> 02:45.130
What is that count and so on?

02:46.070 --> 02:50.630
So we basically will have to add two tables for order in our database.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.710
Let's create them in the next video.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.340
Before we move forward.

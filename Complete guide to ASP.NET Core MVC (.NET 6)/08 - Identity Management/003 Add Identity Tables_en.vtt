WEBVTT

00:01.890 --> 00:07.930
Now that we have the register and I can buy cans here, if we click on register, you will see we get

00:07.980 --> 00:09.510
an error page not found.

00:10.350 --> 00:17.490
And the reason behind that is it is going to identity and then it is adding a parameter of page that

00:17.490 --> 00:18.270
is not correct.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.240
What should be the route to this register page?

00:21.900 --> 00:29.700
If we go back to our solution here, if we examine areas we have identity and then intact pages, we

00:29.700 --> 00:31.440
have account and register.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.330
So if we see the navigation in underscored play out, that is kind of correct, we have the ESP area

00:39.330 --> 00:47.850
as identity and ESP page at a county clerk in ESP interest attack happened that we use for outing with

00:47.850 --> 00:49.020
the reserve pages.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.180
So what is happening?

00:51.390 --> 00:54.660
Why is it not going to the correct route right here?

00:55.740 --> 01:02.580
The reason behind that is if you go to program Garcia's file and when we do the mapping here inside

01:02.580 --> 01:07.680
the services, we have added controllers and we have added greater features.

01:08.340 --> 01:13.230
But if we scroll down in the pipeline, we only have to out for controller.

01:14.450 --> 01:22.850
So here we also have to add that you need to raise our wages only after that speech that you have here.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.790
It will be able to map that properly.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.380
So with that change, let's run the application one more time.

01:33.100 --> 01:38.170
And then if you click on register, it will load the register page right here.

01:39.040 --> 01:39.640
Perfect.

01:40.710 --> 01:46.170
So now the razor pages are working and we can open the register and I can page.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.400
That is great news when you're trying to register here.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.260
You will see nothing happens.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.640
We will fix that added in just a second.

01:56.030 --> 02:02.540
But think about what should happen when a user is registered at that point, it should create some things

02:02.540 --> 02:05.330
or some record inside the database tables.

02:06.410 --> 02:11.420
But if we examine our sequel survey does not have any tables to store them.

02:12.350 --> 02:16.040
Do not ready identity has everything done for you.

02:16.730 --> 02:23.780
If you see in program that since we have configured the default identity and we're using entity framework

02:23.780 --> 02:31.520
stores on the application context, so in order to add those tables, only things that you have to do

02:31.670 --> 02:33.020
is add a migration.

02:34.490 --> 02:40.070
So we will set add migration and Typekit call this an identity to the app.

02:40.820 --> 02:47.510
Now, if you press enter here, you will see error message with the migration reason behind that is

02:47.510 --> 02:49.220
migration that we are adding.

02:49.550 --> 02:57.230
The default project is bulky, but co-EP migration should only be applied where we have DB context and

02:57.230 --> 02:59.270
that is inside the data access.

02:59.870 --> 03:04.400
So if you do not change the default project, you will see this added message.

03:06.060 --> 03:13.290
Also, if you have multiple project, the start up project should be the project with those two changes.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.990
Let's add the migration one more time.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.860
And perfect, it added a migration.

03:20.340 --> 03:21.690
Let's see what it added.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.200
It is creating lots of tables right here.

03:25.770 --> 03:32.400
The main table is Espenak Rolls that is related to roll software user and Espenak users.

03:32.790 --> 03:38.190
That is the table where we will have all the user details for the registered users.

03:38.970 --> 03:44.340
It also has other rules, claims and tables that are needed with the identity.

03:45.590 --> 03:50.000
So you can see all the foundation for cables logging in, sign up.

03:50.300 --> 03:54.830
Everything is done by default, so it will save us a bunch of time.

03:56.160 --> 04:00.840
If we had to implement this on our own, it would have been a huge project.

04:02.020 --> 04:08.470
So once we have the migration, all we have to do is update database to create these tables.

04:10.030 --> 04:11.560
And perfect, that is done.

04:11.770 --> 04:17.440
If they go back and refresh the tables, now you see lots of ESPN add tables.

04:17.770 --> 04:20.950
And these are all identity related tables.

04:21.960 --> 04:25.270
So with that, let's continue from the next radio.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.420
Let me close out the taps here.

04:27.930 --> 04:28.500
Perfect.

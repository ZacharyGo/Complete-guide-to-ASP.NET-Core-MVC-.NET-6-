WEBVTT

00:01.650 --> 00:06.150
We have the default identity user, which does not have much properties.

00:06.760 --> 00:13.890
We want to extend our identity user and create a new model with many more properties for our websites

00:13.890 --> 00:14.460
user.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.340
So inside the Models folder, right click Add a new class file.

00:21.180 --> 00:24.330
We will call this application user.

00:26.280 --> 00:30.690
This will be a public clash, and we want to extend the identity.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.530
Use her if you press control, start here, it will give you the option to instant and you'll get the

00:37.530 --> 00:38.040
package.

00:38.460 --> 00:43.410
We want to install Microsoft Guard extension, guard identity Dutch doors.

00:44.690 --> 00:50.180
If that is not displayed, you can go to the new gate package manager and install that package.

00:51.720 --> 00:56.580
With no application, user has all the properties of identity user.

00:58.040 --> 01:04.760
On top of that, we want to add more properties like, let's say we want the required property fund

01:04.760 --> 01:09.850
name of the user, so which have proper string name.

01:11.090 --> 01:18.380
Then we want the address of the user so we can add strings for address, city, state and postal code

01:19.040 --> 01:20.870
if we want them to be Nullarbor.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.000
We will have to do that as well.

01:23.900 --> 01:30.590
They are not delivered by default, so we can add the question mark here to make all of them no property

01:30.740 --> 01:32.000
and not required.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.270
So that's all that we had to do.

01:35.780 --> 01:38.630
And I believe these are good enough to get started.

01:39.500 --> 01:47.090
So let me see if the application user and we need to create a DPI said for an application, user friendly

01:47.090 --> 01:49.100
application, deep context.

01:50.740 --> 01:57.190
So Vibrant Creative is set on application user and cloud that application users.

01:58.060 --> 02:07.030
Once we do that, we need to add a new migration so that the migration we can limit and extend identity

02:07.060 --> 02:07.720
user.

02:11.170 --> 02:13.600
Of course, we need that data access.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.080
Let's do that again.

02:16.030 --> 02:16.840
And perfect.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.710
You can see all it is doing it inside the Aspen accusers.

02:20.950 --> 02:22.690
It is adding a few columns.

02:23.590 --> 02:26.080
Let's run the Command Update database.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.740
And switch to sequels over.

02:32.390 --> 02:37.040
And if we examine bulky tables, AXP net users.

02:38.270 --> 02:44.180
So if we go on that right side here, we have name, postal code, state and address that was handed.

02:45.350 --> 02:47.720
We have all the properties right here.

02:48.350 --> 02:52.770
But on top of that, a new property got added, which is discriminator.

02:53.540 --> 02:59.120
What exactly is this to see that that may register one more user?

03:06.140 --> 03:11.570
Let's check the register button and let's go back to database refresh.

03:12.380 --> 03:20.720
So the test one that God created will have the discriminator populated as identity user darknet is very

03:20.720 --> 03:22.610
smart when it comes to identity.

03:23.210 --> 03:26.840
Now it knows that there are two types of user in our application.

03:27.380 --> 03:32.000
One is application user and one is the default identity user.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.950
So discriminator is added here.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.230
That way, it can differentiate between an identity user and application user in the later videos when

03:42.230 --> 03:44.000
we create application user.

03:44.360 --> 03:49.100
The value of this discriminator will be application user.

03:50.510 --> 03:55.060
So perfect with that, we have added more properties inside humans here.

03:55.970 --> 04:02.270
But before we come back to this user management, I want to work on something different, which is company

04:02.690 --> 04:07.910
because a user can be either a company user or an individual user.

04:08.970 --> 04:15.600
So let's change our focus for a few videos and get that wrapped up, and then we will come back to the

04:15.600 --> 04:17.010
identity tables.

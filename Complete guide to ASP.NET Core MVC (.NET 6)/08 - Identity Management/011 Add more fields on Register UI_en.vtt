00:01.630 --> 00:07.630
Now that the roads have been created here, if we go back to our web site, when we are registering

00:07.630 --> 00:13.270
for a new account, we have more properties like we have name address of the user.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.810
And let's also display all the roads in a drop down so that we can select the corresponding room and

00:19.810 --> 00:21.370
register now.

00:21.380 --> 00:27.790
Do not worry when we publish or finalize our application, you will not see that option of selecting

00:27.790 --> 00:29.980
Road because that is a bad approach.

00:30.640 --> 00:37.420
You do not want your end user to see if they want to register as an admin user, so we will fix that

00:37.600 --> 00:38.860
in the later videos.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.290
But let's implement that for now.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.920
So let me start the application here and go back to register that see CDMO.

00:49.010 --> 00:54.710
So inside the register model, this is a page model because these are razor pages.

00:55.400 --> 01:02.660
So if you scroll down, we have the input model that is used on the register here, why we have email,

01:02.900 --> 01:04.940
password and confirm password.

01:05.810 --> 01:11.000
We want to add more properties which are there inside the application user.

01:11.450 --> 01:15.390
We can copy them and paste them right here.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.990
Neil will be a required property.

01:19.710 --> 01:26.340
Now that we have added more properties inside the beach model, we can consume them inside the register

01:26.350 --> 01:29.970
page and open that up right here.

01:30.690 --> 01:36.030
Let me just add padding to all the places so that it's more aligned.

01:37.350 --> 01:41.070
Also, I remove the button large on the register button.

01:41.940 --> 01:47.880
Also, if you go back to the register account, we just have email password and confirm password.

01:48.360 --> 01:55.740
But if you notice, in fact, the database for Espenak users, we have a phone number so we can use

01:55.740 --> 01:56.610
that as well.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.050
So right here, that will create a string for our phone number.

02:01.770 --> 02:04.050
Now we can modify the register view.

02:04.350 --> 02:12.900
I will copy the email here and pasted about five or six more times before we get the email.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.760
Let's get the name of the user.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.400
We do not want the auto complete.

02:19.820 --> 02:21.620
I should have removed that.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.140
And perfect.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.930
So after name, we have the street address.

02:33.290 --> 02:39.590
Let me get the phone number first, so we get all the details and then we will work on grass.

02:59.870 --> 03:04.040
So perfect, we have all the details that we are getting right here.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.020
Let me see if this.

03:06.290 --> 03:14.360
And then when we register our user inside the on post is saying we are creating a user if you press

03:14.360 --> 03:17.120
F12 here or go to the implementation.

03:17.630 --> 03:24.210
Create user will just create an instance of the identity user on identity user.

03:24.230 --> 03:28.730
We do not have the custom properties they are inside application user.

03:29.270 --> 03:37.640
So when we create an instance, we want to create an instance of application user with an app using

03:37.640 --> 03:42.020
statement and the return type will be application user.

03:43.230 --> 03:49.470
So let's crawl back up to the create user, then we're setting the username and e-mail.

03:50.340 --> 03:57.810
But I also want to more properties that we have in the register page, which is great address city state

03:58.050 --> 04:05.220
postal code, name and phone number, so we can manually assign all of that to the user object from

04:05.220 --> 04:06.240
the input photo.

04:07.110 --> 04:14.160
This is our razor pages, so it should make sense because we implemented a great website using razor

04:14.160 --> 04:14.760
pages.

04:15.630 --> 04:21.180
Then we're creating a user with the help of user manager and its helper method.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.570
So with that, let me save everything.

04:24.870 --> 04:32.400
And that's when the application inside the cat handler, we still have the code to create rolls, but

04:32.400 --> 04:39.690
that will not be invoked because those rules already exist in the database that check the register button

04:40.290 --> 04:41.160
and perfect.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.750
This looks much better.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.800
One thing that we can do is design this much better.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.380
This use another service to register.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.570
Let's give that some less space.

04:52.200 --> 04:58.590
So let me go to register here, where we'll give this column empty of, let's say, seven.

04:59.620 --> 05:03.940
And the other one, we can give that five and remove the offset.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.580
Let me save this and refresh.

05:07.360 --> 05:07.890
Perfect.

05:08.260 --> 05:14.890
Much better, then we can add two properties in one row we have column empty seven.

05:15.160 --> 05:20.980
I can add a row after that and all the properties here, I can do column six.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.760
So let me paste them one by one.

05:32.650 --> 05:33.820
Let me save this.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.710
And that's good.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.900
Let me go to the top here again.

05:40.060 --> 05:42.700
And we can assign a class of fruit to our fire.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.570
Let's go back and refresh and perfect.

05:47.350 --> 05:48.700
This looks much better.

05:49.330 --> 05:53.620
Let me also add padding top of for to give some space on the top.

05:54.670 --> 05:58.660
And here also will give it a glass of padding top for.

06:00.710 --> 06:06.410
One change I agree to make you more take the first phase so I can cut the email from here.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.480
They stick to the top here.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.940
I will give that column 12.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.140
And this looks much better.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.230
So a registered page is looking good.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.320
If you had to register, we have the validations.

06:21.250 --> 06:27.430
But one thing that is missing here is when we create a user, we want the user to select Roll right

06:27.430 --> 06:31.630
now, so we need to add a dropdown and their display.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.910
All the rules from our database.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.820
Let's do that in the next week, you.

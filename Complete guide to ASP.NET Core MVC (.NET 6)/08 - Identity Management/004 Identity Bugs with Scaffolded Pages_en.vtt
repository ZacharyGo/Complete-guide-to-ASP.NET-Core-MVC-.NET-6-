00:02.360 --> 00:09.470
Now, if we run the application, let's try to register a user when we hit the register button, it

00:09.470 --> 00:10.310
will not work.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.470
So let me add a debugging point.

00:13.340 --> 00:20.180
Also what I'm showing you in this video, I am hoping that the Dark Echo team will fix that very shortly.

00:20.810 --> 00:27.590
So if this works for you, then you do not have to do anything, but it's good to know we will open

00:27.590 --> 00:35.330
the register page motto here and we have the on get handler and we have the on post handler that may

00:35.330 --> 00:37.730
add a debugger on line one one one.

00:39.230 --> 00:49.310
Once we that, let's go here and try to register with it, enter an email and password and hit the register

00:49.310 --> 00:51.590
button, it hits our break point.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.780
You will notice here tomorrow.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.070
State is not valid.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.290
So it will not proceed further.

00:58.070 --> 01:00.350
But why is the modern state not valid?

01:00.710 --> 01:02.660
We have all the fields populated.

01:02.870 --> 01:04.910
Our password is even secured.

01:05.510 --> 01:10.130
The reason behind that is went dark at six when they are checking the market state.

01:10.490 --> 01:14.540
They do not only check this model, they are also checking the return.

01:14.550 --> 01:18.110
You are ill since they are checking the return you are.

01:18.350 --> 01:22.490
You can see the string here is not credible because of that.

01:22.490 --> 01:25.700
If we examined the model state where it's for you.

01:25.940 --> 01:31.250
You will notice the return you are L is invalid because the string is not infallible.

01:31.730 --> 01:33.860
But still what was passed is no.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.470
So the solution here is pretty simple.

01:37.800 --> 01:42.600
Let me stop it here, where would it just make this pretend you were at one level?

01:42.900 --> 01:45.780
And with that, the model state will be founded.

01:46.530 --> 01:52.110
I have a very strong feeling that this will automatically be updated in the next release.

01:52.380 --> 01:57.300
But if this does not work for you, you just need to make this drink and drink.

01:58.610 --> 02:01.700
Same logic, we also have to do in now again.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.290
So let me do that.

02:03.770 --> 02:09.920
We will open up the command post handler and the return to you what we need to make that Nullarbor.

02:11.020 --> 02:14.180
So these are just two small changes that we had to do.

02:14.800 --> 02:20.710
If you work with other pages, then you will have to do the same changes if they are checking for model

02:20.710 --> 02:22.930
state and you get some errors there.

02:23.830 --> 02:27.850
So with these two changes, let's continue in the next week, you.

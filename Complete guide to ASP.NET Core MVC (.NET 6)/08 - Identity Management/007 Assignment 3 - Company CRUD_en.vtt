Now, it's time for our third assignment, this will be similar to what we do with the menu item, but

00:08.970 --> 00:11.940
a lot simpler in this assignment.

00:12.060 --> 00:17.010
I want you guys to create a company model which will have the following properties.

00:17.640 --> 00:25.350
It will be the primary key name will be required and street address, city state postal code and phone

00:25.350 --> 00:25.890
number.

00:26.370 --> 00:28.080
They can be optional field.

00:29.010 --> 00:36.300
Once you create the table, then you will have to add company to repository and unit of work using that

00:36.300 --> 00:37.200
repository.

00:37.380 --> 00:42.390
You need to perform the current operations on company using data tables.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.950
And also we will implement one action four update and edit.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.670
So you will have to do the same like menu item.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.980
So that will give you more practice with data table a that we have.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.830
And of course, validations will be the same.

00:59.820 --> 01:04.470
So good luck with the assignment, and let's continue from the next week, you.

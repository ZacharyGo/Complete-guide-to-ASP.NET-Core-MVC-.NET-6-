00:01.710 --> 00:08.220
No, next thing that we want to do is when we registered a company user user will select a company here,

00:08.640 --> 00:14.310
and at that point, we want to assign this company to the new user that is created.

00:15.210 --> 00:22.260
So if we go back and say we'll have to go to the page model, the company will be inside company I.D.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.800
we want to assign that company already.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.230
Only if the role is comfortable.

00:29.070 --> 00:36.770
So when we are assigning the properties right here, we can check here if input dark role is equally

00:36.780 --> 00:42.120
good as the Dark Company only, then we want the same user.

00:42.120 --> 00:47.670
Dark Company I.D. is equal to input that company 18.

00:48.450 --> 00:53.220
So that will assign the company ID inside the aspirin at user's table.

00:53.910 --> 00:59.850
But you need to make sure that role is also assigned and then we are assigning the roles.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.260
So that is perfect.

01:02.100 --> 01:06.720
Let me restart the application and now register a company user.

01:09.410 --> 01:11.140
So that's what it is to hear.

01:16.230 --> 01:20.040
With a select company here, and let me select Sparky

01:22.860 --> 01:27.540
with that, let's check the register button that got created.

01:27.960 --> 01:35.040
Let me see if there's go back to the database and we'll see the new user right here.

01:35.640 --> 01:40.530
If we go to the right, the company, it should be calculated and perfect.

01:41.340 --> 01:48.660
So with that, all of our users are working as expected and we are able to register the user based on

01:48.660 --> 01:49.650
our requirement.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.170
So everything with identity is looking good.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.900
Let's continue in the next section.

00:01.770 --> 00:05.910
Now, let's run the application and register our first user.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.340
Let's click on the register page here and populate some details.

00:14.090 --> 00:19.760
I'm using had been one to three star as the password so that it is a secure password.

00:20.330 --> 00:27.640
That said, the register button and great, you can see it registers the user and sign in and register

00:27.650 --> 00:29.150
are no longer available.

00:29.570 --> 00:33.110
The user is locked in and we have a lock out button.

00:34.480 --> 00:41.200
If you can block out, it would lock us out and we are back on crutches and again, let's switch to

00:41.200 --> 00:45.460
sequels server and let's examine the ESPN end users table.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.700
Our first user has been created here.

00:49.060 --> 00:55.240
If you scroll to the right here, we have more properties and a user looks good.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.150
So with that, our default registration and log in is working as expected.

01:01.900 --> 01:08.470
But that is not sufficient for a large scale application because what we want is our users will have

01:08.470 --> 01:12.370
roles where they have admin users, we will have employees.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.220
Our customers are also of two types.

01:15.880 --> 01:22.030
They will either be a company customer or they can be individual customer shopping for a book.

01:23.170 --> 01:28.690
So in that case, the user that registers, we have to create some rules for those users.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.710
And also we need to provide board properties for a user.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.360
Right now, the only property that we have for user is phone number.

01:37.780 --> 01:45.340
But typically, we need more details, like name of the user that address city state postal code, etc.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.010
if they want to ship something to that user.

01:48.790 --> 01:53.290
So we need to add our properties of the users of our application.

01:53.980 --> 02:00.370
So in that case, we will have to modify the default implementation that we have if we go to program

02:00.370 --> 02:04.300
that, yes, the default user as identity user.

02:05.140 --> 02:10.540
So now we need a custom implementation, which will extend this identity user.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.870
Let's do that in the next video.

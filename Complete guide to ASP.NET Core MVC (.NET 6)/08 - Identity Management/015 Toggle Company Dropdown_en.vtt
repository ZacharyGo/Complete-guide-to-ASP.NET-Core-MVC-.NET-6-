00:01.760 --> 00:08.390
I want to add some credit here so that the drop down for our company is only visible and company is

00:08.390 --> 00:10.880
selected in the roles down.

00:11.570 --> 00:18.980
So while the application is running, we can go back to the registered e-mail and scroll down.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.860
Let's add some custom JavaScript.

00:23.650 --> 00:28.300
We'll say document dark ready and we'll create a function.

00:30.560 --> 00:35.150
Once the document is ready, we want to add a trigger on this dropdown.

00:35.840 --> 00:41.930
So if you press F12 here and inspect that element, we have the i.d.s in patrol.

00:42.650 --> 00:49.220
So let's add a trigger on input row so we can set dollar cash and patrol.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.100
And on there we have the change event.

00:52.790 --> 00:57.290
So whenever we change the dropdown here, we want to call this function.

00:58.490 --> 01:02.570
We're going to create a variable I call the selection is equal to.

01:03.140 --> 01:05.970
We want to get the text of the current selection.

01:06.770 --> 01:13.520
So if you go to the input text here, whichever option is selected that will have an option of selected.

01:14.720 --> 01:23.870
So in order to get that order based the input rule on top of that, the option should be selected if

01:23.870 --> 01:24.770
that is selected.

01:25.070 --> 01:28.190
Then we want to get the text of that dropped out.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.880
Simple query nothing complex.

01:32.660 --> 01:41.240
Then we can check here if selection is not equal to let's see the selection value, which is company.

01:41.900 --> 01:49.790
So if that is not equal to company, then we want to toggle the next dropdown that we have here.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.280
Let me get its safety input.

01:54.390 --> 01:56.070
Underscore company I.T..

01:57.660 --> 02:04.020
So we want to say Dollar Tash input company, and we want to hide it.

02:04.350 --> 02:12.810
If this election is not company as we want to display that, so else we want to show it that nothing

02:12.810 --> 02:14.790
complex, but this should work.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.110
Let's go back and refresh here.

02:17.850 --> 02:24.690
And if we select anything other than company, it's not possible when we select a company that gets

02:24.690 --> 02:25.200
loaded.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.090
Perfect.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.820
Let me go to the top where we have to drop down.

02:30.390 --> 02:33.540
I would have style of discipline and by default.

02:35.660 --> 02:37.130
Let's refresh the page.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.910
And that is perfect.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.330
Only this last the other drop down.

02:45.710 --> 02:50.040
Now, of course, you can spend more time on validations and making this fancy.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.190
But that is not my main focus.

02:52.670 --> 02:55.700
So if that's continue from the next week, you.

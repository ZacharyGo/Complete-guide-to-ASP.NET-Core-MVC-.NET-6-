00:01.740 --> 00:08.460
In this video, let's take a look at what card added when we scaffolded the identity, and let's start

00:08.460 --> 00:09.300
with the program.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.970
Yes, crossfire here.

00:11.970 --> 00:19.170
We already had the deep context, but what got added is this new line, which is at default identity.

00:19.860 --> 00:26.400
When we're adding identity, it is adding that the services for our container, it is saying that you

00:26.400 --> 00:30.390
have to use the default identity, which is identity user.

00:30.780 --> 00:38.190
And when we use identity for locking register and all those tables, we would require entity framework.

00:38.820 --> 00:44.160
So it is adding entity framework stores, which is on application deep context.

00:44.820 --> 00:49.190
So this is doing all the mapping of our identity with entity framework.

00:49.270 --> 00:55.080
Over here, we have option that you can only signing in if your email is confirmed.

00:55.570 --> 01:01.500
We're going to remove that for now because we did want the account to be confirmed before logging in.

01:02.160 --> 01:08.670
Then if you scroll down when you are configuring Ahmedabad, you will notice a new middleware was added

01:08.820 --> 01:13.320
between routing and authorization, which is use authentication.

01:14.100 --> 01:20.610
This is the middleware for authentication and authentication should always come before authorization

01:21.150 --> 01:25.020
because you can only authorize a user if they are authenticated.

01:25.620 --> 01:29.070
You never authenticate a user after they are authorized.

01:29.460 --> 01:36.270
So if you're trying to move authentication after authorization, then the authentication will not work.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.160
So when you are working with Metal Badge, the order is extremely important.

01:42.150 --> 01:46.680
So those were all the changes inside the program that a yes class file.

01:47.490 --> 01:50.910
Next thing that card added is inside our alias folder.

01:51.370 --> 01:54.240
Now it added a new area for identity.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.940
If he explained that we have pages and all of them are reserved pages.

02:00.690 --> 02:07.710
So if you examine register, for example, here we have to register page and we have page model like

02:07.710 --> 02:09.540
we saw in reserve pages.

02:10.410 --> 02:17.220
So all the identity related stuff will be using the reserve pages and not MVC application.

02:18.090 --> 02:25.590
So that's why I give you a small foundation on how reserve pages and the page model works inside this

02:25.590 --> 02:26.250
register.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.880
We have a constructor.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.290
We are getting fewer things using dependency injection.

02:31.740 --> 02:32.670
We scroll down.

02:32.760 --> 02:39.440
We have a model that we are finding and we have to get handler, post handler, et cetera.

02:40.380 --> 02:47.010
This is pretty straightforward to what we learned in reserve benches, but with identity, I want to

02:47.010 --> 02:53.910
show you one thing when we are working with signing in a new user, creating their password, assigning

02:53.910 --> 02:58.710
them roles, etc., we need to implement all of those functionalities.

02:59.400 --> 03:04.500
But with the identity class library, we get all of them implemented for us.

03:05.130 --> 03:09.150
We have sign in manager, user manager, role of manager.

03:09.510 --> 03:15.990
All of them have helper methods to sign in a user to create that account if they want to assign roles

03:15.990 --> 03:17.880
to a user and all of that.

03:18.630 --> 03:21.630
We do not have to implement all those complex logic.

03:22.020 --> 03:29.430
Everything is done by default, so that will save a lot of time when we want to add identity to our

03:29.430 --> 03:30.060
project.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.910
If you want, you can customize everything that is added here.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.460
But we will work with the basic stuff.

03:37.820 --> 03:41.030
And of course, we're there to do some customizations as well.

03:42.310 --> 03:45.550
So that is a brief overview of what got added.

03:46.240 --> 03:51.550
One last thing that got added other than identity pages is inside views.

03:51.970 --> 03:57.240
Now we have a new partial view, which is like NPR show in here.

03:57.250 --> 04:04.420
If a user is signed in or display a lockout button and their email address here, if the user is not

04:04.420 --> 04:08.290
logged in or displayed that locking and quite a start button.

04:09.460 --> 04:15.160
So that being said, it makes sense to include this large and partial inside our layout page.

04:16.360 --> 04:23.650
So if they scroll down after this, you will element here, let me add a partial view with the name

04:23.650 --> 04:24.970
of log in our show.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.270
Let's save that and see what happens.

04:32.220 --> 04:38.280
Great, you can see on the right hand side, we have the register and Larkin, let me go back to the

04:38.280 --> 04:39.970
partial view here.

04:39.990 --> 04:41.130
The text is dark.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.140
Let me get him off that because our navigation is dark itself.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.720
Let me save that and refresh here for a fact.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.620
With that, let's continue from the next radio.

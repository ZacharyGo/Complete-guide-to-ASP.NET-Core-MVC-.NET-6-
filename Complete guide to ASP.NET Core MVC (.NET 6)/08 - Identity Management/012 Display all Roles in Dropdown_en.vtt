00:01.780 --> 00:05.800
Now I want to add a dropdown here that will display all the rooms.

00:06.520 --> 00:13.060
So if we go back to the application, we will stop this and we will work on the register page model.

00:13.510 --> 00:17.770
We have the cat handler in order to display a dropdown.

00:17.890 --> 00:25.390
We need an innumerable select list item so we can add that inside the input model that we have.

00:26.260 --> 00:32.680
So at the end here with phone number, I will add and I enumerable off the select list item.

00:33.220 --> 00:37.840
I will call that as a rule, the best way to make sure we are validated.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.970
Never because we never want any validations on this I enumerable.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.130
Then we can load this inside the cat handler using projection.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.620
We are not passing any input model here because it is empty by default.

00:54.220 --> 01:01.630
Right now, we want to populate the row list, so we will say input is equal to a new input model.

01:03.370 --> 01:06.820
And on this, we just want to populate our row.

01:07.190 --> 01:10.390
Next, we want to use our database for that.

01:11.290 --> 01:17.650
Now how can we get all of the rules that are present inside the table of ASP.NET roles?

01:18.550 --> 01:25.510
As I said before, we have the helper method intact for the manager, so we do not have to access our

01:25.510 --> 01:28.070
application to be context right now.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.340
So what role manager?

01:30.640 --> 01:36.610
We have roles and on that we can do a select projection from all the roles.

01:36.670 --> 01:39.280
We just want to select more of the role.

01:39.970 --> 01:47.110
Once we select the name, we will use projection on select statement and we will protect that to a new

01:47.260 --> 01:49.090
select list item.

01:51.020 --> 01:58.340
And when we create that, we kind of signed the text and value, so text will be the name and the value

01:58.340 --> 01:59.840
will also be I.

02:00.410 --> 02:03.590
Because names will be distinct when we are working with roles.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.110
So this will not be an issue.

02:06.950 --> 02:12.950
So we have to role that is populated with the help of projections and billing statements.

02:13.730 --> 02:17.540
But projections basically does is where we have some list here.

02:17.990 --> 02:21.470
It will project or extract some data back here.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.420
It is just extracting name.

02:23.930 --> 02:27.860
And then we are projecting that name to a select list item.

02:28.790 --> 02:33.470
So in the end, it will be an innumerable off the select list item.

02:34.220 --> 02:34.940
Pretty cool.

02:35.810 --> 02:39.320
Lastly, we just need to display this inside the dropdown.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.570
So instead, register here.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.070
Like my copy?

02:43.070 --> 02:48.170
That div based pasted one more time I can remove the validation.

02:48.590 --> 02:50.150
This will not be an input.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.250
It will actually be a select.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.870
So let me start from scratch.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.480
We have the ASP for tag helper.

02:56.990 --> 03:03.350
We need to bind it to some property so that whatever we select from the list of rules is binding.

03:03.590 --> 03:10.070
When the form is posted so far that we need to create one more property inside our model.

03:10.430 --> 03:14.780
We will call that as a rule and we can make it available as well.

03:15.710 --> 03:22.760
So the input for this we can set input back rule, then we need to get the role list.

03:23.480 --> 03:32.060
So roll list will be the tag helper ASP items and that is inside models that input dark raw list.

03:33.530 --> 03:39.560
Now, if you do not want the Model S. such as binded, you can just use input to the list, after all.

03:40.700 --> 03:47.780
Finally, let's get rid of bootstrap class form select, and that looks good if you want.

03:47.780 --> 03:55.580
You can add a default option which will be disabled where we can say select run at me, save this and

03:55.580 --> 03:56.810
run the application.

03:58.870 --> 04:02.740
So if I go to register now, we should see the list of roles.

04:03.190 --> 04:03.790
Perfect.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.440
That looks great.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.110
But right now, the rules are only displayed.

04:08.830 --> 04:13.480
What we need to do is find this electoral here and hit the register button.

04:13.870 --> 04:16.690
Users should be created with federal.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.930
Let's do that in the next video.

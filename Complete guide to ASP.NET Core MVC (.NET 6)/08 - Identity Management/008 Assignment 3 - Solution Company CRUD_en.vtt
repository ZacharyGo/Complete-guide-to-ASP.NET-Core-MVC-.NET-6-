WEBVTT

00:01.880 --> 00:08.300
So let's get started with our assignment and get to that super quick, first thing, we need to create

00:08.300 --> 00:08.900
a model.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.100
Let's do that.

00:12.470 --> 00:19.880
This will be company model, whether it make this a public place, and we want all the properties,

00:20.090 --> 00:20.480
which is.

00:21.410 --> 00:29.900
Name, street address, city state postal code and phone number the one at the bottom, we have marked

00:29.900 --> 00:33.260
them as label and name is the required property.

00:33.860 --> 00:36.620
It will be the primary key by default.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.170
So our model looks good.

00:39.860 --> 00:47.750
Let's add that in the DB context we can add to be our on company and their contact companies, and we

00:47.750 --> 00:49.730
will have the getter and center.

00:50.750 --> 00:54.710
Once we add that in, our DP said we can add migration.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.280
I recall this ad company DP.

00:58.770 --> 00:59.780
And let's add that.

01:02.090 --> 01:02.810
Look scared.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.180
Let's update the database here.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.610
And perfect, then we need to work on the repository for our company.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.300
So let's go to our repository, a repository.

01:16.770 --> 01:20.880
I have a copy cover tape pasted here for our company.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.880
We will have to make some changes to the interface.

01:27.900 --> 01:28.980
Let me do that.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.520
This will be on company.

01:32.910 --> 01:37.050
And we want to update a comfortable object, looks good.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.010
Let's copy the color type.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.600
They start again for the implementation this time.

01:43.830 --> 01:50.260
We have company repository that will copy the name and at that.

01:51.120 --> 01:57.840
Make sure you are working on the company repository where they change the classroom and update everything

01:57.840 --> 01:59.280
in this repository.

02:00.060 --> 02:00.990
Let me deal with that.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.470
Perfect.

02:08.950 --> 02:15.940
That looks good for the repository that will copy the interface name here and go to our unit of work

02:16.960 --> 02:21.070
will implement a company repository called That Company.

02:21.430 --> 02:22.840
We will have to get there.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.720
Let's do the unit at work here.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.680
The public eye company.

02:32.470 --> 02:41.050
And initialize our company as a new cultural repository and perfect with that, we have can't figure

02:41.590 --> 02:42.240
it out for it.

02:43.090 --> 02:44.860
Let's go back to the presentation.

02:45.280 --> 02:50.710
The last thing is to perform operations on company using data tables.

02:52.260 --> 02:55.920
So that will be similar to what we did with menu items.

02:58.020 --> 03:02.640
So I mean, we have controller same thing that we did with product.

03:03.480 --> 03:10.290
So let me copy the product controller here it and I will call this as company controller.

03:13.890 --> 03:18.450
Let me modify everything inside there to be company.

03:21.110 --> 03:25.460
We do not need the Web hosting that because we are not working with the files.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.140
So let's remove that.

03:28.830 --> 03:34.740
And we do not even need a new model, so we can just work with a basic company object.

03:35.370 --> 03:36.210
Let's do that.

03:42.640 --> 03:49.960
Then insert absurd if it is now we can just return back company here, and if the idea is populated

03:50.500 --> 03:52.210
with a load, are comfortable.

03:56.950 --> 04:02.920
To The View, we return back the company motto, so an absurd cat looks good.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.020
Let me remove the comments here.

04:08.930 --> 04:11.360
Let's work on the abstract post here.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.700
We work, receive a comfortable object.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.740
We do not have to work with files so we can remove all of that.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.180
We will check a fair bit of it is equally equal to zero.

04:25.660 --> 04:31.630
That means we have to add a company or else we have to update that company.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.260
That's correct this time data.

04:36.370 --> 04:39.910
Half have the company created and updated.

04:40.890 --> 04:41.910
That looks good.

04:42.410 --> 04:47.620
Let's also modify the API calls for our data table this time.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.500
We want to talk about the company.

04:50.010 --> 04:52.470
We do not have any enclosed properties.

04:53.420 --> 04:58.020
We're going to call this company list and let me finish that here.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.640
That looks good on lead.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.800
We will be working with company so that they modify that.

05:05.190 --> 05:11.220
We do not have any image here, but we just have companies that remove OPG.

05:12.210 --> 05:12.960
So perfect.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.060
Our company controller looks good.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.270
Next to what we have to work on is the views.

05:19.050 --> 05:22.980
So if we go back to Atman, we have the views for product.

05:23.460 --> 05:30.570
Let's copy and paste them one more time where they change the folder name as company to match with our

05:30.570 --> 05:31.530
controller's name.

05:32.690 --> 05:40.800
Think it's that comfortable that we open up the index and absurd and inside W WW Road we where we've

05:40.800 --> 05:45.010
copied the product as they stood here for our company?

05:45.060 --> 05:45.600
Yes.

05:46.530 --> 05:47.970
Let's open that as well.

05:48.330 --> 05:51.090
These are the three files that we need to fix now.

05:51.870 --> 05:55.260
Let me modify everything here to be company again.

05:55.920 --> 06:01.890
It will be create a new company controller will be a company controller looks good.

06:02.820 --> 06:06.420
Next is to display the properties that are related to company.

06:06.810 --> 06:12.960
So I will add those to each element for name, address, city, state and phone number.

06:14.450 --> 06:16.070
Let's modify the absurd.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.500
We won't be working with your model.

06:18.890 --> 06:21.080
We directly have the company model.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.800
Then we will need the IED inside hidden property.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.140
We're not going to emerge here.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.840
We'll just be using Model I.D..

06:33.040 --> 06:40.810
Where will display company here next, we need to modify the properties based on company so that we

06:40.810 --> 06:41.470
do that.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.920
Let me remove everything else that we have here.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.350
I just keep this separate button.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.950
First thing here will be the name of the company.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.820
Let me copy and paste it here.

06:55.690 --> 06:59.770
Then let me copy and paste this about four more times.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.940
So after name, let's have a phone number for the company.

07:07.430 --> 07:09.650
And then we can work on the actress.

07:15.910 --> 07:20.830
So perfect, we have phone number, address, city, state and postal code.

07:22.010 --> 07:28.040
Then if the idea is not zero, we want to update and we want to create here.

07:28.070 --> 07:32.570
We do not want any custom function for our controller.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.230
The name of the company ActionScript Index.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.410
We do not need any image.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.530
We can't remove that.

07:40.930 --> 07:41.920
Let's scroll down.

07:42.460 --> 07:48.640
We cannot hope that tiny mercy, all the custom function, we can't remove that script.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.230
That looks good for the absurd method.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.780
You can clean this up if you want.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.120
But the absurd looks good.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.580
Let's go on index right here in the U.S. when the company docked.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.370
Yes, let's go here.

08:06.860 --> 08:07.550
We don't have.

08:08.150 --> 08:14.750
We have name, street address, city, state and phone number.

08:17.970 --> 08:23.490
So if you get the error rate data table, make sure to find out what is returned from the JASON.

08:23.700 --> 08:30.210
And I'm pretty sure it will just be a casing mistake or a spelling mistake inside the data properties.

08:31.300 --> 08:31.630
Thank you.

08:31.660 --> 08:35.030
Whatever the admin company get.

08:35.050 --> 08:35.430
Oh.

08:36.770 --> 08:41.630
That's the carpet, this company that will be for absurd and delayed as well.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.340
Let's scroll down.

08:43.550 --> 08:43.940
Yep.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.130
Everything else looks good.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.410
Lastly, we need to update our underscored lay out.

08:52.220 --> 09:00.230
And instead, the content management that will copy one and tag posted here from the company controller.

09:04.690 --> 09:11.560
Well, combat as comfortable with that, let me run outside of the ocean, and I believe everything

09:11.560 --> 09:12.340
should be done.

09:13.950 --> 09:17.220
So let's go to content management, we have company.

09:17.670 --> 09:19.290
Let's create a new company.

09:20.890 --> 09:29.050
Populate the details and hit the reset button and perfect all the credit operations should also work

09:29.320 --> 09:30.700
if I change that.

09:33.610 --> 09:39.220
Let me add a fake company here and try to delete that whole perfect.

09:42.910 --> 09:47.050
I will create two companies here, and that should be sufficient.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.260
With that, let's get back to our identity.

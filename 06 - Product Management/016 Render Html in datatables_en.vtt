00:02.310 --> 00:08.580
Now inside our data table, I want to add, edit and delete buttons when we click the edit button.

00:08.850 --> 00:14.130
It should take us to the absurd page, but this time it should populate the product details.

00:15.430 --> 00:24.130
So how can we add that inside our data table on the data table related stuff will be in product DR Yes,

00:25.060 --> 00:27.670
we were using simple columns right here.

00:27.990 --> 00:34.840
We want to add one more column, so make sure your uncomment the text that we added before and then

00:34.840 --> 00:37.000
you can add one more column here.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.390
But this time we do not want a simple column.

00:40.660 --> 00:47.440
We want to render some HTML like add buttons when we render, edit or delete button.

00:47.620 --> 00:55.350
We will require the idea of the product, so data will be the idea of the product then, along with

00:55.390 --> 01:03.020
which we have something called as render when you want to render some HTML content inside the data table.

01:03.100 --> 01:08.080
Well, this will be a function where we go past the data.

01:09.960 --> 01:16.600
So data here is nothing but the idea of the product that users select inside here.

01:16.620 --> 01:19.050
We want to return some HTML.

01:19.410 --> 01:25.530
I want to make it on my timeline, so I will use the sign that is below the tool sign and just above

01:25.530 --> 01:27.000
the tap on keyboard.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.930
With that, we can write multi-line like this.

01:32.190 --> 01:35.130
So inside here, we want to create two buttons.

01:35.970 --> 01:41.100
Let's go to the index view that we have inside areas +1.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.790
We have the views category index view.

01:46.030 --> 01:48.190
Right here we have these two buttons.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.800
Let me copy that.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.850
Go back to our product.

01:52.100 --> 01:52.600
Yes.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.030
And pasted right here.

01:56.100 --> 02:03.450
When we are inside JavaScript, we cannot access the ESB controller and those tech helpers with it have

02:03.450 --> 02:07.890
to write the extract manually to navigate to the absurd page.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.440
So that is inside admin.

02:11.220 --> 02:14.670
We have product and in there the action is absurd.

02:15.240 --> 02:22.500
When we add --, we want to pass the IDE so we can add a question mark or it is equal to.

02:22.920 --> 02:27.150
We can use the string interpolation and visual data.

02:28.080 --> 02:35.860
Let me remove everything that we have and delete your safeties and go back and refresh and full effect.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.370
You can see two buttons edit and delete.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.750
When we click Edit here, you can see that you water at the bottom.

02:43.050 --> 02:45.390
It is automatically appended.

02:46.380 --> 02:54.750
So if we click it, it should take us to the absurd page and we have the idea and parameters so that

02:54.750 --> 02:56.820
our render function is looking great.

02:57.030 --> 03:04.290
When we are working with data table in the next video, let's make sure that when there is an ID in

03:04.290 --> 03:07.680
the absurd, the data should be populated.
